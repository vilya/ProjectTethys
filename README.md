Project Tethys
==============

This is my entry for Ludum Dare 29. The theme is "beneath the surface".

Scientists working in an undersea lab have developed a powerful new weapon,
codenamed "Tethys". Bad guys have got wind of this: they're coming to destroy
the lab and abduct the scientists, so they can claim it for themselves. Your
job is to defend the scientists and the lab. You have a submarine equipped with
all the latest technology; how long can you keep the attackers at bay for?
