Project Tethys
--------------

- Similar gameplay to Defender, Resogun, etc.
- Set underwater and you're driving a submarine.
- You have to defend an undersea lab (or multiple labs?) from attackers.
- Researchers out doing dives may be abducted by the bad guys; you have to rescue them.


Enemy types
-----------

Fighter   - Moves towards the player, firing at them.
Bomber    - Moves across the screen, dropping bombs when it's above either the
            player or the base.
Minelayer - Follows an arbitrary path across the screen, spawning mines as it goes.
Mine      - Stationary, triggered by proximity. When triggered, it starts a
            short countdown before exploding.
Kidnapper - Homes in on the nearest scientist outside the base. When it gets to
            touching distance, it collects the scientist and runs for the left
            or right edge, whichever is nearest.


Weapon types
------------

Laser     - The default weapon.
Torpedo   - A slower moving but more powerful weapon, will home in on enemies
            which come within range of its sensors.
Shockwave - A wave of pressure radiates out from the player, forcing enemies
            back. Deals a small amount of damage to enemies and destroys any
            bullets or torpedos it touches. The blast also triggers the
            proximity sensor for mines.


Objectives
----------

Protect the base
- If the base is destroyed, it's game over.
- Shoot down enemies that are attacking it before they can do too much damage.

Destroy enemies
- You must destroy all enemies in each level to progress.

Rescue scientists
- Each level starts with a set number of scientists which need rescuing.
- The scientists will either start out in the open, or emerge from the base as
  time passes.
- You can pick up any scientists out in the open and take them to safety on a
  ship parked above.
- Rescuing them gives you bonus points at the end of the level.
- If a scientist has been picked up by an enemy, shooting down the enemy will
  free the scientist.
- You must rescue a minimum number of scientists to progress?


Win conditions
--------------

You progress to the next level when you have done all of the following:
- Destroyed all enemies.
- Rescued a sufficient number of scientists?
