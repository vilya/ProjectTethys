Project Tethys
--------------

- Similar gameplay to Defender, Resogun, etc.
- Set underwater and you're driving a submarine.
- You have to defend an undersea lab (or multiple labs?) from attackers.
- Researchers repair the lab while they're inside it.
- Researchers may have to venture of the lab at some points. While they're
  outside, they can be abducted by the bad guys; you have to rescue them.


Enemy types
-----------

Fighter   - Moves towards the player, firing at them.
Bomber    - Moves across the screen, dropping bombs when it's above either the
            player or the base.
Minelayer - Follows an arbitrary path across the screen, spawning mines as it goes.
Mine      - Stationary, triggered by proximity. When triggered, it starts a
            short countdown before exploding.
Kidnapper - Homes in on the nearest scientist outside the base. When it gets to
            touching distance, it collects the scientist and runs for the left
            or right edge, whichever is nearest.


Weapon types
------------

Laser     - The default weapon.
Torpedo   - A slower moving but more powerful weapon, will home in on enemies
            which come within range of its sensors.
Shockwave - A wave of pressure radiates out from the player, forcing enemies
            back. Deals a small amount of damage to enemies and destroys any
            bullets or torpedos it touches. The blast also triggers the
            proximity sensor for mines.


Objectives
----------

Protect the base
- If the base is destroyed, it's game over.
- Shoot down enemies that are attacking it before they can do too much damage.

Destroy enemies
- You must destroy all enemies in each level to progress.

Protect scientists
- You start out with no scientists in the base.
- Scientists get air-dropped in as a kind of power-ups.
- You collect them while they're dropping & take them to the base.
- While they're in the base, they'll repair it over time.
- The more scientists in the base, the faster it'll get repaired (up to some
  maximum).
- The scientists will sometimes have to make trips out from the base to gather
  materials or something.
- While they're outside, they're vulnerable:
  - They can be killed by the bad guy (or by your own "friendly" fire)
  - They can be kidnapped.
- If a scientist is kidnapped, shoot down the enemy carrying them will free the
  scientist & they will try to return to the base.


Win conditions
--------------

- If you survive through all of the waves, you win. Simple!
- Beyond that, the aim is to get the highest score.
